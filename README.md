🔐 Security-Enhanced Fund Transfer System

📌 Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the security of electronic fund transfers (EFT) over the internet by leveraging Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for encryption and SHA-512 for secure hashing. The system ensures fast, reliable, and secure financial transactions while preventing fraud and unauthorized access.

🔒 Security Mechanisms:

🔹 AES Encryption (128-bit, 256-bit): Secures transaction data.

🔹 SHA-512 Hashing: Protects passwords and sensitive credentials.

🔹 One-Time Password (OTP): Ensures multi-factor authentication.

⚙️ Core Modules:

User Authentication:

🔹 Secure Sign-in/Signup with SHA-512 hashed passwords.

🔹 PHP Mailer for OTP verification via email.

Fund Transfer System:

🔹 Internal & external account transfers.

🔹 Scheduled transactions & bill payments.

Secure Transaction Processing:

🔹 AES encryption for secure data transmission.

🔹 OTP verification before fund transfer execution.

🛠 Implementation Platform:

🔹 Languages & Tools: PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MySQL.

🔹 Security Libraries: OpenSSL, PHPMailer.

🔹 Browser Compatibility: Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
